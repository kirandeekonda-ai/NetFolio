- âœ“ Performance/Scalability Improvements (modular refactoring)
- âœ“ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements (data binding issues)
- âœ“ Technology Stack Upgrade (productization standards)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Transform the current functional prototype into a production-grade MVP by refactoring the codebase for maintainability, fixing broken data flows between UI and database, standardizing LLM integration, and implementing comprehensive error handling and real-time updates.

**Impact Assessment**: âœ“ **Significant Impact** (substantial existing code changes)
- Requires architectural changes to data flow patterns
- Cross-cutting refactoring of multiple components
- Integration layer standardization

#### **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals**:
â€¢ Transform prototype codebase into maintainable, modular architecture
â€¢ Fix broken data flows ensuring real-time UI updates from database
â€¢ Standardize and abstract LLM provider integration
â€¢ Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems
â€¢ Complete missing analytics features for categorized transactions
â€¢ Establish production-grade development and deployment standards

**Background Context**:
The NetFolio project successfully proved the concept of AI-powered personal finance management but was built using rapid prototyping with AI agents. While functional core features exist (authentication, statement processing, basic categorization), the lack of structured development methodology resulted in technical debt that prevents scaling to production quality. The user has identified specific broken integrations between the UI layer and database, particularly in the Home, Dashboard, and Categories pages, along with missing real-time data updates and incomplete analytics features. This enhancement addresses the critical transition from "working prototype" to "production MVP."

**FR3**: The Dashboard Page must display complete financial data from the database, including accurate total balance calculations, monthly income/expense tracking, and functional spending-by-category analytics with working chart visualizations.

**FR4**: The existing LLM integration must be standardized and abstracted to support seamless provider switching (Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Custom) with consistent transaction extraction and balance detection across all providers.

**FR5**: All user actions (statement upload, categorization, account management) must provide comprehensive feedback including success/failure notifications, progress indicators, and error details.

**FR6**: The codebase must be refactored into modular, maintainable components with clear separation of concerns, eliminating redundant logic and implementing consistent logging patterns.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

**NFR1**: The refactored system must maintain existing performance characteristics while improving code maintainability, with no degradation in page load times or transaction processing speed.

**NFR2**: All data flows between UI components and the Supabase database must be real-time, utilizing Supabase subscriptions for immediate updates across all pages.

**NFR3**: The modular architecture must support easy addition of new features without requiring changes to existing core functionality.

**NFR4**: Error handling must be comprehensive and user-friendly, with no unhandled exceptions reaching the user interface.

**NFR5**: The LLM provider abstraction layer must support easy addition of new providers without code changes to transaction processing logic.

### **Compatibility Requirements**
