# NetFolio Feature PRD: Categorization-to-Dashboard Integration

## Financial Problem Statement
**Current Issue**: After users categorize transactions, there is no clear path to see the categorized data reflected in the dashboard. Users categorize transactions successfully, but the dashboard remains empty or shows outdated data, breaking the core financial analysis workflow.

**Target Users**: All NetFolio users who upload statements and categorize transactions for financial analysis

**Financial Workflow Integration**: This feature bridges the critical gap between transaction categorization and financial insights, enabling the complete NetFolio workflow: Upload → Process → Categorize → **Analyze & Visualize**
